Holy Geeta by Swami Chinmayananda 
General introduction To Bhagawad Geeta 

IF THE Upanishads are the text-books of philosophical principles discussing man, 
world and God, the Geeta is a hand-book of instructions as to how every human 
being can come to live the subtle philosophical principles of Vedanta in the 
actual work-a-day world. 
Srimad Bhagawad Geeta, the Divine Song of the Lord, occurs in the Bhishma Parva 
of the Mahabharata, and comprises eighteen chapters, from the 25th to the 42nd. 
This great hand-book of practical living marked a positive revolution in 
Hinduism and inaugurated a Hindu renaissance for the ages that followed 
the Puranic Era.
